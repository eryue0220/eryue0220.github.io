## Forwards

Hi there. This is my first post writen in English. I plan to write some tech note what I am doing or I am interested in. Last month, I resigned from Ant Group, and I decided to start a new development job. I will document my thoughts on the new job, interview experiences, and some preparation content here.

I will make it a personal requirement to write blog posts and documentation in English, but sometimes, out of laziness or for the sake of convenience (not wanting to look up words in the dictionary), I may also write in Chinese.

## Current

Now I feel dead good without the pressure of having a job. It gives me more energy to focus on writing code for projects that interest me. In the past month, I have submitted several pull requests to open-source projects. I hope to continue this momentum in the future.
