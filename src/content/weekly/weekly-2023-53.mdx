# Weekly-53

## The Summary of 2023

Today it’s the last day of 2023.  Last post in this year. It’s a long time since the last weekly blog. At the beginning of this year, I hoped I can write a post every week to record what I did in that week and wrote some tech posts. However, this year, I just wrote some posts and one tech blog. Beside that, in 2023, there are some changes about my self, the biggest part I think is that I resigned from Ant Group. I felt dead tired, stressed and frustrated. I can’t stay there any more, maybe someone told me it’s a pity. but I felt that good since I left then, and currently I think it was a good decision.

### The Good Part in this year…

- Contribute to the OSS Projects
  - Jest
  - oxc
  - orogene
  - unplugin-stylex
  - opendal
  and others

- Learned to swim.
  Finally I learned to swim

- Learned and improved English.
  - Started to writing post in English
  - Learn in Duolingo everyday

- Start to listening Books and Podcast
  It’s really good things that I tried in 2023. I really enjoyed listening many variety of contents, maybe they shared experience or knowledge, even their routine. And especially I really like to listen when I take a shower.

- Go to bed early and get up early.
- Reading one book per month at least.

### The Not Good…

- Too distracting. I alway switched my context, in some degree it’s bad for myself, which means I need to spend more time to engage a new project from another project, although it pushed myself to learn more new thing, for me personally, I haven't gained much accumulation.
- Learn to Drive. I planned to get a driver’s license since 2022. But it’s still uncompleted in this year.
- Memorizing English Words. Unfortunately, in 2023, this habit was not maintained.
- Accounting. Unfortunately, in 2023, this habit was not maintained too.

That is my 2023, it’s not good but also not bad.

## In 2024

- More Focus
  - I need to manage my energy and attention to prevent make myself burn out. In Tech I think will focus on three areas and these following repos:
    - Rust
      - oxc
      - rolldown-rs
      - lightingcss
      - orogene
    - FrontEnd and Framework
      - Astro
      - stylex / unplugin-stylex
      - Jest / vitest
      - Nest.js
    - Learning K8S / AWS / Docker
- Improve my verbal English
- Accounting.
- Start record my time.
- Keep Reading

But now it’s my just thought in my mind. The more detail and plan I will update in next I hope. 

2023 Bye.
