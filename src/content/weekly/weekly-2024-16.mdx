# 2024.04

I haven't written my monthly record in English for a long time. It’s time to pick it up again. Last month was a little busy, that’s why I postpone writing my monthly post. Unfortunately, I had a cold again.

## Open Source

This month my open source work still focused on the oxc-project and some micro front framework, which aligns with my recently job. For the oxc-project, this month I just completed two rules and another one is on the way:

* [2911](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/2911)
* [3110](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/3110)
* [3146](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/3146)

Next month I will still complete other two or three rules and thus I can complete all the eslint-plugin-jest rules in oxc project.

I publish unplugin-stylex v0.3, it now supports webpack and rollup, which should have been included in  the initial version. I’m also trying to support astro, farm and rolldown framework, but there is still bugs in framework

* [30](https://github.com/eryue0220/unplugin-stylex/pull/30)
* [32](https://github.com/eryue0220/unplugin-stylex/pull/32)

In addition, I started to explore and learning [nocobase](https://nocobase.com/), it’s a no-code or low-code platform. Currently, I am trying to implement a plugin of [LDAP](https://ldap.com/), which is a protocol like oauth or saml, but it’s different. This’s my first encounter with LDAP, and I plan to write a technology post to introduce and record it once the plugin is completed in next one or two weeks 🚩. I have never write post about technology this year:(. As regards why I want to join in this platform, because I love productivity tools, which may help people more effective.

## Reading

I only complete one book, that is ***Beating the Street*** by Peter Lynch. But it’s a little challenging for me to understand. I think I still feel naive about my trading skill. I also start to reading his another book, ***One Up On Wall Street: How to Use What You Already Know to Make Money in the Market.*** I haven’t complete yet and find it more difficult than the previous one. So now I listening this book on my wechat reading app, which can give a first impression, and will give a help when I next step start to read it.

## Trading

I didn’t open any new positions, I’m still maintaining the same positions which I mentioned in my last monthly post, because I believed TSLA still has much space when its FSD starts selling. As for RDDT, to be honest, I admit I was a bit impulsive. However I think it will come back.

## English

Although my spoken English didn’t have much improvement, but the good part is that I restart to written my monthly post in English. And I will start to watch these English video to practice my English listening skill:
