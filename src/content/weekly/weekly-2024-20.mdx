# 2024.05

This is my second english post of this year, it’s a good hobbit that I hope I can continue to do. This month was a bit different, but still busy.

## Open Source

This month about open source, still tried to solve oxlint rules about `eslint-plugin-jest` implementations:

* [3358](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/3358)
* [3436](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/3436)
* [3437](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/3437)
* [3439](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/3439)

On the other hand, I started to reimplement oxc project playground, but currently it is in the early stage, and still a lot of work or bugs need to complete.

And my personal project [unplugin-stylex](https://github.com/eryue0220/unplugin-stylex), we finally welcomed a new developer besides me, and contributed a new issue and commit, and the numbers of npm has reached over 200, it’s too small now, but it’s also an encourage for myself.

## Reading

This I just read a book about health, called Glucose Revolution. It’s a really great book I read this year. And it changed me a lot different thought, and it still changed my life style. But another book, Outlive:The Science and Art of Longevity, I still read. I hope it also can give me more helpfulness.

## English

I bought new books, but I didn’t start to read it. I do have to start next month and improve my vocal.
