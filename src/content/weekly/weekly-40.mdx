# Weekly 40

# Have a try

From this week, I will start writing my weekly note in English, and this is my first one. Any questions or problems about this or me is welcome, issue [here](https://github.com/eryue0220/eryue0220.github.io/issues). 

Now, let’s begin.

# This week…

I found a part-time front-end job, but it’s not enough money to support me living in current city, another part-time full-stack job is still undetermined, maybe after Mid-Autumn Festival. After three months gap, I hope I can get my first paid from my first remote job. And I’ll continue to seek a remote job, if you have any offers, contract me. There’re also some interviews in local, I have no confidence to get there, BUT it’s a good way to practice my verbal English skill.

About English learning and IELTS, as you see, this is one of part, this week, I began to shape my English listening through `xiaoyuzhou` or Spotify’s podcast, it’s still little hard if the speaker talk quickly that I will miss. And last week I came back from my hometown, and my schedule routine has messed up, I need some time to adjust.

As for the open source work, I opened two PRs about oxc and Jest. I have struggled with the benchmark test, and I also received some good suggestions from the community, but I wanna try to solve it by myself, it’s a nice method to improve my skills.

This week, I also read one book about C program book called 《C言語ポインタ完全制覇》，alias [《征服 C 指针》](https://book.douban.com/subject/21317828/) in Chinese. Believe it or not, this is my first finished C book and completely understanding. Why I learn C and read the book, because I just want to understand the [libuv](https://libuv.org/), maybe contribute something in future.

# Finally

Thanks for the Google translate and openai to help me complete this weekly.
