# Weekly 41

## New Month

Today is October 6th (while I was writing this post), 2023 will finish in three months. How time flies. Review the past three months, I made many changes or decisions, about my job and life. Now I don’t want to review my last few months performance,  But I am willing to make the plan about this month. First, I RESTART to keep accounts  for my daily expenditure, I was lazy previously. Second I make a plan about these books I may read in October.  Finally, I hope I can find a job in this month.

## Jobs

This month, I have received many interview invitations. I feel a little tired and stressed because I need to prepare for a long time before each interview. I don't know if it's worth it or not, but I have to do it. And next week, I will have my first interview in English. Good luck to me.

## Open Source

This week I just submitted one [PR](https://github.com/orogene/orogene/pull/300) about orogene. And next week I may have time to complete the new feature that support engine, also, I will complete the lint rule about the [oxc](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc/pull/938). If I have more time, I would like to read the codebase about [llhttp](https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp) and [llparse](https://github.com/nodejs/llparse) or start to read the [servo](https://servo.org) project, which I am interested and focus for a long time.
